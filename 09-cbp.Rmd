# Border Patrol: A Second Boomeranging {#CBP}

United States Border Patrol (BP) has played an outsized role in policing and corrections within the federal immigration system and abroad both in support of armed services and independently [@Miller2019].
Indeed, BP has provided another boomeranging of the Imperial Tetherball that bridges the Vietnam-era and present-day domestic applications via export to foreign governments for use in controling their own populaces.

## International Trafficking 

Within a year and a half of the fogger's arrival to US domestic police agencies, BP agents were engaging foreign governments independent of the military on chemical weapons deployment including using thermal foggers.
During April 25 - May 9 of 1970, Raymond Dee Bond, a Border Patrol agent with decades of experience, sold $15,000 worth of chemical weaponry to the Mexican federal government [@ValleyMorningStar1973_08_04].
Included in the cache were multiple pepper foggers and formulations [@ValleyMorningStar1973_08_04].
Bond was caught and charges with weapons trafficking and acting as a foreign agent without notifying the Secretary of State [@DailyNews1972_10_27].
Although indicted by a federal grand jury, Bond was able to escape prosecution by resigning from his position  [@ValleyMorningStar1973_08_04].

Given the extensive reach of Border Patrol into Central and South America fueled in particular by the 'Drug War' [@Chepesiuk1999], it is reasonable to expect that this was not an isolated event.

## BORTAC 

By 2020, the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) had been established to, among other tasks, provide particularly extreme responses to domestic as well as foreign uprisings [@CBP2006; @CBP2014; @CBP2018].
BORTAC is truly a global domestic law enforcement agency, operating in 28 countries (they were willing to publicly disclose as of 2006; @CBP2006), providing a wide range of services [@CBP2014; @Miller2019].
BORTAC's specific genesis was focused on riots in federal immigration detention centers [@CBP2006; @CBP2014], noteworthy given the use of thermal foggers in the United States [carceral system](#CarceralSystem).

Border Patrol agents from the El Paso unit specifically were deployed to police protests in El Paso in addition to being sent to Portland and other cities like Albuquerque, New Mexico [@Borunda2020].


### Portland OR {#PortlandOR2020_2021}

The thermal fogger made a very visible return to the public sphere in July of 2020, when US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers brought a bright-green version to Portland, OR during the [2020 Black Lives Matter protests](#PortlandOR2020_07_29) [@pb20202021].
Since then, the fogger has been deployed [three additional times by CBP in Portland](#PortlandORICE2020_2021), all at the property Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rents on the South Waterfront.


#### July 29 2020 {#PortlandOR2020_07_29}

At the beginning of July 2020, then-president Trump deployed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents to "protect" federal property in Portland, OR [@DHS2020; @Flanigan2020; @Trump2020].
During the final days of the visible presence and response of federal agents in Summer 2020, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) unveiled their thermal fogger [@Recompiler2020_07_29], which has been identified through photos as an [IGEBA TF35](https://www.nixalite.com/product/igeba-tf-35) thermal fogger from Nixalite of America Inc.
This machine is designed and marketed for bird control, and while "_training tool for military/law enforcement_" is listed among its uses [@Nixalite2009a], its safety requirements explicitly state: 

> "_**19. Do not fog directly against persons...During operation keep distance of minimum [10 ft].**_"  - [@Nixalite2009b]

In the front of the left side is an agent holding a plastic clear riot shield, through which you can see a patch that say 'Border Patrol Federal Agent' in yellow and some insignia patches as well. In the middle are the agents in camo, one with a hand on the shoulder of another who is operating a thermal fogger machine shooting gas through the fence. The machine is maybe four or five feet long and has a body not unlike a bush whacker with a two-cycle engine, but fueling a vaporizer instead of a rotor. The agent is holding the machine with their right hand visibly and there is a black strap across their shoulder holding it up. The machine is mostly shiny metal, although the tip is showing signs of corrosion (no surprise based on the compounds and heat) and the supports of the body are a bright green."}

#### Abolish ICE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement Rental Property {#PortlandORICE2020_2021}

While the thermal fogger hasn't been deployed at the federal Courthouse in downtown Portland since July 29 2020, it has been used repeatedly by Department of Homeland Security agents at the private property US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rents to use as a holding center for deportees in the South Waterfront neighborhood [@Simonis2021] -- the same building that saw the weeks-long Occupy ICE protests in 2018 [@Dubois2018]. 

The first of such deployments occurred during the fall of 2020.

Along with cities across the country, Portland hosted many events on October 17th focused around the racial and gender justice [@Recompiler2020_10_17].
In the evening, there was a gathering at Willamette Park in the Southwest part of the city, where organizers passed out balloons detailing harrowing experiences of migrants and immigrants detained by ICE [@Recompiler2020_10_17].
After marching to the ICE rental property, individuals tied the balloons to the gate to the parking garage, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers deployed massive amounts of chemical weapons, including via a thermal fogger, throughout the neighborhood [@Recompiler2020_10_17].

It is night and there are additional clouds of gas and the shapes of people in the background."}

#### Inauguration 2021 {#J20}

The same fogger (or at least the same model) was again brought out at the ICE rental property on January 20th 2021 during the Inauguration Day ("J20") Abolish ICE protests in response to an individual spray painting a piece of plywood tacked outside the building [@Recompiler2021_01_20]. 
The fogged up and down multiple blocks, with visible plumes entering units in the adjacent apartment complexes and covering the playground of an adjacent public school [@Recompiler2021_01_20; @Simonis2021].

One person standing alone in the center of a road, shown from the waist to the ankles. The person is wearing work pants with covered pockets at the thighs and calves, long sleeve shirt, and a glove on the right hand. In the left hand they are gripping the handle of a neon green fogger tool. The long black nozzle, covered with a wire cage, projects backwards and the motor is towards the front. It is being held at hip height; the arm holding it is relaxed down."}

That weekend, CBP deployed the fogger again during Abolish ICE protests, this time gassing even more of the neighborhood, including the local public school and veterans-preference housing [@Recompiler2021_01_23; @Simonis2021].

Two officers dressed in full protective gear with bulletproof vests holding supplies on, with the word POLICE stenciled in yellow. They are both wearing helmets and gas masks. The nearer one is holding a gas fogger in the right hand. Thefogger looks like a long tube between 3 and 4 feet long with a handle and motor parts near the back. The tube is covered with a wire cage until about the last half foot, which is a plain and narrower tube. Behind these two officers are some dimly lit buildings and one or two other officers but they are not clear."}

A white stripe on the roadway has the words MELT ICE spray painted on it."}
