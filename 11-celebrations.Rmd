# Celebrations {-}

On occassion, police forces have used foggers against protests or riots that are more of a celebratory nature but still do not respond to their commands to disperse.

### 1975 New Years Eve {-}

New Year's Eve 1975 was apparently quite raucous in Florida, as many cities experienced revelry that got out-of-hand enough to elicit police use of force [@TheTampaTribune1976_01_02].
In Ft. Lauderdale, party-goers pulled down a traffic light and police deployed multiple foggers on a crowd of 2,500 on the beach [@TheTampaTribune1976_01_02].

The mayhem was noteworthy enough to garner publication in the Berkeley Gazette [@BerkeleyGazette1976_01_02] as well as the Tampa Tribune [@TheTampaTribune1976_01_02].


### 1974 NHRA Nationals {-}

Indiana State Police used a pepper fogger and gas grenades on a crowd of 2,000 drag racing fans blocking a highway between the track and campsites at the Hot Rod Association's US Nationals in Clermont IN, September 1 1974 [@Courier1974_09_02; @TheBillingsGazette1982_01_10].
