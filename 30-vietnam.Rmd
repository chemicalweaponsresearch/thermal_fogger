# Vietnam {- #Vietnam}

The modern day use of thermal foggers for chemical weapons deployment was born from the American colonization of Vietnam in the mid-to-late-20th Century [@USMACV1965; @Bunker1996].

## Context {-}

### Mosquito Control {-}

Early in the deployment of US troops to occupy Vietnam, the need for large scale mosquito control became so great that soldiers began improvising insecticide foggers by piping insecticide into diesel truck exhaust:

>  An insecticide fogger, one of the most useful improvisations, was made by mounting a [55-gallon oil] drum filled with 6 to 7 percent malathion insecticide in diesel oil ... on a 3/4-ton truck and spraying the poisonous mixture out with the exhaust from the vehicle. The insecticide is drawn from the drum by the partial vacuum in a line connected to the exhaust pipe just behind the manifold, and sprayed out under pressure of the exhaust.

The hack turned out to be __*4,500 times*__ more effective, covering nine square miles per day compared to 50,000 square feet (0.002 square miles) per day using a conventional manually operated fogger [@Spicknall1969].
Given widespread mosquito concerns and the preponderance on diesel drums, the truck approach spread, and the concept of fogging was understood among servicemembers [@USMACV1965; @Spicknall1969]. 

### Tunnels  {-}

As the occupation continued, underground bunkers and tunnels dug by the Viet Cong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAV)  became a dominant presence on the both the literal and figurative battlefields [@Rottman2006; @Rottman2012].

<br>

Each house has a shelter and they are connected via tunnels. There is a puji-stake moat with a sharpened bamboo fence around it surrounding the village and there's one road in, with a gate at the fence. There is a river or open water of some kind on the other side of the fence and then some fields and jungle. The community building is two stories and is next to a single flag on a pole in the center of the village. The flag is blank, and so functionally white.", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tunnels.jpg")
```
<br>

Soldiers from the US, Australian, New Zealand, and other armies were tasked with clearing the tunnels and "rooting out" inhabitants [@Hemmings2019].
The specialized forces designated for the work were dubbed "Tunnel Rats" and tear gas was part of their arsenal to "flush" individuals from caves, which they regularly deployed via pyrotechnic grenades and powdered explosives [@NewYorkTimes1977; @Rottman2006].

## Genesis {- #Genesis}

### Implementation {- #FirstUse}

In October of 1965, the USMACV (United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam) was supporting the South Vietnamese Army's (ARVN) III Corps in a "search and destroy" operation in the Iron Triangle, an area known to house an elaborate Viet Cong tunnel system [@USMACV1965].

<br>

(ref:imgirontriangle) US-defined War Zones C, D, and the Iron Triangle near Saigon, Vietnam [@USArmy2005]
  
```{r imgirontriangle, out.width = out_width2, fig.cap="(ref:imgirontriangle)", fig.alt = "Text-book style map of the III Corps Tactical Zone from 1965-1967, according to the legend. This is the area of Vietnam around Saigon, with some of the South China Sea visible to the south at the bottom and Cambodia to the north west in the upper left portion. Major highways and cities are indicated on the map, but the main points are the color highlighted boundaries of the two war zones and the iron triangle, which are all in reddish organge, and the full tactical zone in a darker blue. There is text in the bottom left that says Map 13 and there is a unit bar in the legend that gives distances in both miles and kilometers.", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/iron_triangle.jpg")
```

<br>


The US Chemical Advisor to the ARVN's Chemical Team participated in planning the operation, and suggested using a Mity Mite (a.k.a. Mitey Mite, Mighty Mite) 2-cycle thermal fogger to aid in clearing tunnels. 
A 6-member unit of ARVN Chemical Team members was organized on October 7th for implementation of the fogger [@USMACV1965].
The next day, the force located a tunnel and set into motion an elaborate scheme to fog the tunnels with [hexachloroethane (HC)](https://chemicalweaponsresearch.com/hc) smoke from burning pots, marking the first known tactical use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons agents [@USMACV1965; @Rottman2012].
Overall, the endeavor was dubbed a success, despite the tunnel already being empty [@USMACV1965].

Although (highly toxic; @Simonis2020) munitions smoke was used in this application, it was noted that tear gas would be "very effective in flushing VC from tunnels" should there been any present [@USMACV1965]. 

According to the *Lessons Learned* report filed by the USMACV the next month,

> This is believed to have been the first tactical employment of Mity Mite _by ARVN_. [emphasis added] 
>
> --- @USMACV1965

Note that there is no mention of use by USMACV prior to this deployment [@USMACV1965].

### What About Not In Tunnels? {-}

Seeing the Mity Mite in action got the wheels turning in the heads of USMACV officers, and the idea of deploying the fogger outside of tunnels was on the table [@USMACV1965].

This is made clear in the *Lessons Learned* report, where they state that the  

> Mity Mite portable blower can be used to ... generate an agent cloud for use against unmasked personnel __in the open__ ... [emphasis added] 
>
> --- @USMACV1965.

At the time, however, the set up used powder, pot, and grenade sources of chemical agents, which was inefficient and required extensive supplies and gasoline reserves [@USMACV1965].

## Expansion {-}

The practice caught on quickly, and Mity Mites were soon issued to ARVN units [@USMACV1965] and became common tools for Tunnel Rats [@Rottman2012].

``` 
  

<br>

The Army used foggers to pump "air" or "smoke" into tunnels in combination with "riot control agents" during Operation Cedar falls in 1967 [@Lehrer1968]. 
And by 1968's Battle of Khe Sanh, it was standard practice to use foggers for tunnel excavation as well as mosquito and fly control [@Rottman2006].

In 1969, the US Army Limited War Laboratory published a report on chemical weapons that included a section on foggers and agents for use in them, naming the [General Ordinance Equipment Corporation](#GOEC) and [Federal Laboratories](#DefenseTech) models that were already in production and a propsed development of a formalized truck-based fogger [@Samuelsetal1969]:

## International Melting Pot {-}

Other countries explicitly supported the US colonization in Vietnam, providing a pathway for the fogger to be rapidly picked up by the armed forces of other nations.

By 1966 the Australian Tunnel Rats were particularly fond of fogging tunnels with acetylene [@vietnam_aus1; @vietnam_aus2].

[As expected](#TheReturn), the fogger quickly made it to Australian police departments, although with a decidedly negative response from the news media, who called it "highly controversial" admist a Sydney Police spending scandal [@Allen1972].
Unnamed Australian arms experts who spoke on background said there was no application for the fogger in the country [@Allen1972], although that hasn't stopped its use elsewhere.
