# Introduction {-}


Late in the night on July 29th, during the height of the 2020 Uprising in Portland (OR), as protesters gathered outside the Hatfield Federal Courthouse to fight for racial justice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) used a thermal fogger to deploy unknown chemical agents on the crowd:

With this seemingly novel usage, DHS made a large swath of the populace aware of an insidious weapon that is actually not new, but -- in fact -- was [birthed](#Genesis) in the American occupation of Vietnam, [perfected](#The1968Convensions) for use against domestic protesters in the 1960s and '70s, and [sent abroad](#CBP) via CBP in the years since. 
The subsequent [return](#PortlandOR2020_2021) of the thermal fogger to use against civilians domestically by the same domestic law enforcement agency (CBP) that sent it abroad after its initial domestic use is an extension of the classical Imperialist Boomerang [@Cesaire1950; @Arendt1951; @Foucault1976; @Graham2013] that can be more aptly described as a tetherball.

Despite repeated use of thermal foggers to deploy chemical weapons over the last half century, the device appears to have slipped from the zeitgeist, only to reemerge in the city that experienced the most visible federal deployment of chemical weapons [@Flanigan2020] and weapons-based incidents of police brutality at racial justice protests (regardless of population size) [@pb20202021], perhaps due to the noteworthy density of photographers and videographers.

Although not all of the weapon's history is documented, enough is that we can quickly dispel the myth that this deployment was _new_ in any notable sense other than being recent.


## The Science of Thermal Fogging {- #Science}

Broadly speaking, a fog is a visible aerosol that hangs in the air near the ground, and while it occurs on its own accord, humans have devised a variety of methods to generate fog.
And many, if not all, of those methods have been used to deploy chemical weapons on people.
The focus of this book is on __thermal__ fogging.
The idea behind thermal fogging is the same whether you're targeting mosquitoes in a marsh or protesters on a street: flash-vaporize a liquid being forced into a stream of cooler air, causing a fog to form as it condenses; move to increase the size of the cloud. 

The original chemical weapons thermal foggers employed the exhaust lines of diesel trucks or manifolds of 2-cycle engines to heat the formulation, which worked but were bulky and difficult to control in open areas [@Crockett1969].
These models were quickly supplanted by foggers leveraging resonant [pulsejet technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsejet) that were streamlined, lighter, and gave control of the stream to the operator [@Applegate1969]

Regardless of the heating method specifics, the machine creates a visible fog from the mixture of gasoline exhaust, chemical weapons, and ambient air moisture, as desired. 

Although the mixture does cool considerably from its peak temperature before being released, the chemicals are heated to such high temperatures that they thermally decompose, creating a much more toxic mixture of gases that condense to form the fog.
Indeed, the thermal cracking temperatures of common chemical contemporary chemical weapons are well below the temperatures achieved in a thermal fogger:

- Phenacyl chloride (CN): 248 C [@Compton1987]
- 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS): 450 - 550 C [@Xueetal2015]
- Oleoresin Capsicum (OC): < 200 C [@HendersonandHenderson1992]
- Hexachloroethane (HC): 185 C [@IARC1979]
- Terephthalic Acid (TPA): 445 C [@KimyonokandUluturk2016]

As a result, it is impossible for anyone to definitively know what chemicals they are fogging someone with, but it is fair to say the mixtures are likely to have considerably higher toxicities than product labels and safety sheets indicate, which are already concerning [@defteccs].
