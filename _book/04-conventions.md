Deployment of chemical weapons on United States civilians by domestic law enforcement began in earnest in the late 1960s during the height of anti-war and civil rights protests, kicked off in particular by the 1968 Republican (Miami, Florida) and Democratic (Chicago, IL) National Conventions [@McArdle2018; @TaylorandMorris2018].
As a result of a [heavy propaganda and branding campaign](#TheReturn), the thermal fogger was just becoming a mainstay of early police chemical weapons arsenals.
Importantly, by the summer of 1968, the Florida Highway Patrol, Chicago Police Department, and California State Police all had purchased foggers.

Beyond their legacy as the first domestic fogger deployments, the lingering impact of the 1968 Conventions was felt for years to come.
The Kansas City (Missouri) Police Department armed up their chemical weapons cache in advance of the 1976 Republican National Convention, including purchase of fogger fluids [@Hudson1976].

## Miami, August 8 {- #MiamiFL1968_08_08}

The first use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons in the US that I have been able to uncover was during the "[Liberty City Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Miami_riot)", which took place in during the [1968 Republican National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Republican_National_Convention) (RNC) in Miami, Florida [@Tschenschlok1995; @Tschenschlok1996; @McArdle2018].
A white reporter with the Miami Herald attempted to gain access to rally of concerned Black people that was meant to be only among Black people that was occurring in Liberty City, a Black neighborhood, on August 7th [@Tschenschlok1995; @Tschenschlok1996].
When the reporter was ejected from the rally, Miami police responded with a large and heavy presence and during the standoff, a white motorist with a "Wallace for President" bumper sticker attempted to drive through but was met with resistance and drove into another car, and fled the scene on foot [@Tschenschlok1995; @Lorentzen2018].

Miami police used chemical weapons the night of the 7th, but the fogger did not make an appearance until the subsequent day.
Local, state, and federal officials met with Black organizational representatives the night of the 7th and had agreed to continue discussions the morning of the 8th, but instead sent staffers rather than appear themselves, which effectively ended discussions [@Tschenschlok1995; @Tschenschlok1996]. 
Apparently, Miami Police Department was unable to manage the situation and Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) was called in by the city [@Tschenschlok1995].

FHP used a truck with multiple foggers [@Lorentzen2018], described as "essentially a modified version of an insect-control machine" that "spread a thick fog of tear gas throughout the riot zone" [@Tschenschlok1995]. 

FHP used the truck-mounted thermal foggers indiscriminately and caused visible symptoms (gagging, etc.) in all present, including a 5-month old [@McArdle2018].
The fog quickly spread into neighborhood homes, forcing residents outside to seek fresh air [@Tschenschlok1995].


## Chicago, August 26 - 29 {- #ChicagoIL1968_08_26}

Later that month anti-war protests took place in Chicago, Illinois during the [Democratic National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention), and a massive force of law enforcement (Chicago Police with assistance from over 6,000 National Guard members and 6,000 Army troops [@TaylorandMorris2018]) responded excessively, including with chemical weapons, on network news [@Schultz1969; @Karnow1983; @Farber1988; @Langguth2000]. 
After four days, hundreds had been given medical assistance for exposure to chemical weapons [@TaylorandMorris2018].

Although I have yet to find contemporary documentation of fogger use during the convention, an AP report on fogger use in [Berkeley the year later](#BerkeleyCA1969_02_21) states

> A similar device was used during demonstrations in Chicago during the Democratic convention last summer. - @TheDailyTribune1969_02_21

As such, I consider this a very likely deployment.
I am continuing to search for evidence.


## Berkeley, August 31 {- #BerkeleyCA1968_08_31}

A demonstration in Berkeley, California was called by the Young Socialist Alliance, Independent Socialist Club, and the Black Panther Party in solidarity with anti-war protesters in Chicago who the police had recently brutalized [@PatersonEveningNews1968_08_31; @TheCapitalTimes1968_08_31], including [use of a pepper fogger](#ChicagoIL1968_08_26) [@TheDailyTribune1969_02_21].
In response, police brutalized the protesters, and in the process brought out a hand-held pepper fogger, a "new police weapon... which produced a gas that caused sneezing" [@PatersonEveningNews1968_08_31].

Deployment of the thermal fogger was covered in newspapers around the country including Paterson, New Jersey [@PatersonEveningNews1968_08_31]; Hanford, California [@TheHanfordSentinel1968_08_31]; Honolulu, Hawaii [@TheHonoluluAdvertiser1968_09_01]; St. Louis, Missouri [@StLouisPostDispatch1968_08_31]; Franklin, Pennsylvania [@TheNewsHerald1968_08_31]; Madison, Wisconsin [@TheCapitalTimes1968_08_31]; and El Paso, Texas [@ElPasoHeraldPost1968_08_31], a city whose significance was already budding.

It is clear from the photograph shared with the United Press International (UPI) copy that the fogger used is a [GOEC](#GOEC) brand pepper fogger, which hit the market the month prior [@USTPO2018].
The GOEC thermal fogger was so new, it would not have a trademarked name ("Pepper Fog") for another year [@USTPO2018].

## Coming Soon To A Town Near You! {-}

Following the conventions, the fogger quickly became a part of the law enforcement arsenal. 
US police had a hard time containing their glee when purchasing and testing thermal foggers for use on domestic civilians, as a general media blitz played out across the country through the late 1960s and early 1970s [@PlainDealer1971].

### Illinois {-}

In the wake of the [1968 Democratic National Convention](#ChicagoIL1968_08_26), Chicago-area police played an outsized role in promoting the propaganda line.
The pepper fogger was touted as being able to "empty a house fast" by Cook County Illinois Sheriff Joseph Woods [@MtVernonRegisterNews1969_04_09; @DailyDispatch1969_04_09], a definitely off-spec and dangerous use [@Nixalite2009b].
The volume of fog emitted was also said to be able to fill [Soldier Field (capacity 61,500 fans)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field) in under a minute [@DailyDispatch1969_04_09].
Regardless, the Chicago-area Sheriff decided they needed three of them [@DailyDispatch1969_04_09].
The Sheriff's Major in charge of chemical arsenal Anthony Yucevicius noted the fogger's psychological effect on recipients, as well saying

> They make a terrifying noise and probably will have a scare effect on crowds. 
>
> --- @TheTerreHauteTribune1969_04_08.

Use expanded among and within states, as by 1972 the Illinois State Police also purchased three foggers, which they trained with in Springfield [@Robinson1972].
In news reports, the foggers were described as

> a cross between a machine gun, a power lawn mower, and a sun lamp. 
>
> --- @Robinson1972.

### Florida {-}

Similarly, following the [1968 Republican National Convention](#MiamiFL1968_08_08), Florida law enforcement took to the fogger [@Cain1968].
In Sanford (1970 pop. 17,393; @USCB1970), the local police department purchased a fogger for use with [CN gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenacyl_chloride), noting that it could shoot fog 20 ft for up to a 15 minute stretch, and so would be effective for controlling large masses [@Cain1968].
They had, however, only used it in training and for demoing to the media [@Cain1968].

<br>

### California {-}

Eager to not be shown up by the police in Berkeley, by 1970, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department had already purchased their own fogger for their "big artillery" to use "when other forms of persuasion have failed" and started a media campaign [@Michals1970].
The department and new state regulations required officers to be trained in chemical weapons use, which was set up through Officer Robert Hawkins [@Michals1970].

### National Guard {-}

Following the Kent State Massacre, the Ohio National Guard, as well as others around the country began equipping their forces with thermal foggers, using the death of those students as justification for massive purchaing of "less lethal" options [@Bandy1970].

### Small Town USA {-}

No matter the size of the town, by the early 70s, police wanted in on that sweet sweet fogger action.
The Brigham City (Utah; 1970 pop. 14,007; @USCB1970) Police Department leveraged federal Omnibus Crime Act money to purchase a variety of weapons to use against protesters in 1971 [@BoxElderAgencies1971].

Police Chief Jay Christensen noted that the fogger provides a longer shelf-life than grenades and reportage noted that it 

> emits a continuous stream of smoke, chemical irritants, or **whatever solution** is fed into it. [emphasis added] 
>
> --- @Robinson1972

Use of federal funds to purchase chemical weapons, and specifically foggers, was not limited to one department.
Cities, counties, and states across the country used Omnibus Crime Bill money to up their chemical weapons caches, including foggers [@Conheim1972].
For example, Oakland County in Michigan (1970 pop. 907,871; @USCB1970) purchased two pepper foggers for their South County Tactical Mobile Unit with part of their $21,066 in 1970 [@Conheim1972].

Oneota New York (1970 pop. 16,030; @USCB1970) purchased a fogger in 1969 during the anti-war demonstrations, although the department bungled its response to protests [@Griffin1973].
As came to light during a public probe, Oneota Police Chief Joseph F. DeSalvatore requested a limited amount of training in the budget, and officers were therefore unable to deploy the fogger or other chemical weapons [@Griffin1973].

Gaston County North Caolina (1970 pop. 47,322; @USCB1970) Sheriffs purchased a fogger, which they turned on but not used to dispense agents multiple times by 1970 in their jail system "when there's been trouble brewing" [@Balloch1970].

Apparently the threat of [death by chemical weapons fog](#BigMac) is sufficient to scare detained individuals into compliance.


Within a few years, however, departments began to realize they had no need for the machines, and began selling them with no use aside from testing [@DesMoinesTribune1975_05_06].
The Storm Lake Iowa (1970 pop. 8,591; @USCB1970) purchased a fogger in 1971 in advance of a motorcycle rally that never happened, and used free advertising in local media in attempts to pawn it [@DesMoinesTribune1975_05_06].
The article/ad mentions that officers have used foggers "on occasion" in Des Moines (Iowa's capital; 1970 pop. 201,404; @USCB1970) in addition to [one instance on the University of Iowa's campus](#IowaCity) [@DesMoinesTribune1975_05_06], although I have not located contemporaneous mentions.


### Crossing to Canada {- #Canada}

Canadian law enforcement was also quick to jump on the fogger train and the media were just as happy to propagandize their use [@Patterson1976].
A convention of US and Canadian police chiefs held in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1976 provided a glimpse into the state of affairs by mid-decade, at which point a supply chain had clearly been developed, although weapons salesmen refused to be named or have their statements linked to employers [@Patterson1976].
