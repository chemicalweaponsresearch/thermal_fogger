# The Return {-}


As to be expected following the basic of the Imperial Boomerang [@Cesaire1950;@Arendt1951;@Foucault1976], the repressive technique (thermal fogging) developed by a country (USA) to control colonial territories (Vietnam) will be used by the same country (USA) on its own people [@Graham2013].

Indeed, it took just _three years_ from initial deployment in Vietnam on October 8 1965 to first application in the United States to gas Black racial justice protesters in Miami on August 8th 1968 during the Liberty City Riots [@Tschenschlok1995; @Lorentzen2018]. 

The return of the fogger was aided significantly by the weapons industry, militarization of US police forces, the transition of veterans to law enforcement occupations upon returning home, and substantial propaganda in a variety of specialized and generalized outlets.

## General Ordnance Equipment Corporation {- #GOEC}

The General Ordnance Equipment Corporation (GOEC), who developed and trademarked Chemical Mace the year prior, began using the phrase "Pepper Fog" in July 1968 on their thermal fogger line and applied for a trademark on the phrase in October of the same year [@USTPO2018].
By the end of August 1969, GOEC had received the trademark on "Pepper Fog", which they (and their subsequent owners including Smith and Wesson, Federal Laboratories, and Safariland) retained until it expired in 1991 [@USTPO2018].

There's also a handle and some knobs on the top of the item and something that's a little bit difficult to make out off the back of the main body." style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />

Indeed, to this day, the current owner of the legacy branding ([Safariland](https://www.safariland.com) subsidiary [Defense Technology](https://www.defense-technology.com)) continues to sell items under a ["Pepper Fog" line](https://www.defense-technology.com/product-category/pepper-foggers/), including a ["pepper fog generator"](https://www.defense-technology.com/product/pepper-fog-generator/) that utilizes the same pulse-jet generation technique:

## Rex Applegate {-}

A major figure in the translation of military "riot suppression" tactics to domestic law enforcement in the 1960s and 1970s was a former US Army Lt. Colonel named [Rex Applegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Applegate).
Applegate took a commission as a second leuitenant, but had a lung ailment kept him from serving in combat in World War II and so was assigned to Military Police Company before being tapped by [Col. William Donovan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Donovan) to build and run the School for Spies and Assassins in the Office of Strategic Services [@Goldstein1998].
Larger than life, Rex even served as bodyguard to President Franklin Roosevelt, before retiring and moving to Mexico at the end of World War II to consult with Central and South American governments on "riot control" [@Goldstein1998].

Applegate returned to the US in the 1960s during the civil rights and anti-war protest era and began proselytizing the good word of the thermal fogger [@Applegate1969; @Applegate1970].
Indeed, Rex published what can only be described as a long-form written sales pitch for the GOEC Pepper Fog thermal fogger in the highly circulated _Guns_ magazine in 1970 [@Applegate1970].

## Gary Willis {-}

Alongside the more overtly pro-police-use-of-chemical-weapons propaganda of Rex Applegate were other, perhaps more subtle forms.
For example, Pulitizer Prize-winning [Garry Wills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Wills) (who at the time was considerably more conservative than he became to be later) penned an op-ed that ran in (at least) The Herald Statesman (Yonkers, New York) and The Charlotte News (Charlotte, North Carolina) in April 1971 titled "Tear Gas Tears" in which he basically tells all the cry babies (pun intended) to suck it up because he "would not be afraid to undergo such experiences [as being pepper fogged] again" [@Wills1971].
Notably, he touts the leading belief at the time that somehow thermal fogging is a "safe immobilizer of individuals" [@Wills1971], despite the weapon not being demonstrably safer than gas grenades and notonly not "immobolizing" but explicitly designed to mobilize immobile resisters.
Interesting, Wills compares indiscriminate and uncontrollable chemical weapons as "safer than dogs, which get out of control, bit bystanders (and even other cops) as well as 'the bad guys'" [@Wills1971].
He concludes his piece by calling tear gas "human in ... foreign wars [and] domestic encounters" [@Wills1971]), speaking clearly to the return, classically defining an Imperial Boomerang [@Cesaire1950;@Arendt1951;@Foucault1976].
