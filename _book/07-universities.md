# University Cities {-}

Perhaps instigated by the willingness of the California Highway Patrol to use chemical weapons (including thermal foggers) in [Berkeley on and around the University of California campus during the 1968 Convention protests](#BerkeleyCA1968_08_31), many law enforcement agencies escalated anti-war and racial just protests in University towns during the 1960s and 1970s via chemical weapons.

The willingness of police to fog literally any place where undergraduates standing up for racial justice and against imperialism were gathering was highlighted in May of 1970 when [Maryland State Police deployed chemical weapons via thermal fogger into the University of Maryland Chapel](#CollegeParkMD1970_05_04) [@Cabe1970].


## Durham {-}

Durham North Carolina Police broke up the "Allen Building Demonstration" taking place February 13 1969 on the campus of Duke University in Durham using a variety of weapons, including a thermal fogger [@DMH1969; @Schreiberetal1971a; @Schreiberetal1971b].
The police reportedly chased protesters across campus with the fogger, including using it inside Duke Chapel [@Schreiberetal1971a; @Schreiberetal1971b].

#### February 21 1969 {- #BerkeleyCA1969_02_21}

A year after [using the fogger on a protest held in solidarity with the Chicago Protest](#ChicagoIL1968_08_26), police in Berkeley again deployed a fogger to clear demonstrators including striking students from outside a University Regents and Sproul Hall plaza on the University of California campus.

#### February 28 1969 {-}

#### May 15 1969 {-}

Alameda County sheriffs deployed a pepper fogger on UC Berkeley's campus again during the "People's Park Riots" of 1969 [@LATimes1969; @Hayes1970].

The riot apparently started when the university tried to prevent individuals living on the street from a volunteer-run park they built on a lot owned by the school [@ThePressDemocrat1970_10_13].


The Sheriffs were joined by the California National Guard once again, who this time fogged neighborhoods from the back of a Jeep:

## Seattle {-}

Seattle Washington police deployed CN and CS gas via a new pepper fogger in their clash with "hundreds of unruly youths in the University District" on August 14 1969 [@StatesmanJournal1969_08_17].
Witnesses recounted that the machine was "highly effective", filling "2-3 blocks of a street with tear gas in about a minute" [@StatesmanJournal1969_08_17].



## College Park {- #CollegeParkMD1970_05_04}

On May 4th 1970, students gathered at campuses around the country to protest President Nixon's expansion of war into Cambodia, inlcuding in at the University of MAryland (UMD) campus in College Park [@WAS2013].
Police responded with chemical weapons that did not deter the protest, but rather moved it around the campus [@Cabe1970].
By later in the day, UMD students had heard about the Ohio National Guard shooting four Kent State students and took up a position in front on and inside the UMD Chapel [@WAS2013], which did not stop the chemical weapons barrage or the use of the fogger specifically [@Oates1970]

## Iowa City {- #IowaCity}

Johnson County sheriffs - including two deputies carrying pepper foggers - used chemical weapons against protesters in Iowa City, Iowa IA on May 6 1971  [@Eckholt1971].

The chemicals deployed smelled like insecticides and were described in print as "unidentified" because the Sheriff refused to publicly name the compounds, including to the news media [@Eckholt1971].



## Minneapolis {- #Minneapolis1972_05_10}

Thousands of anti-war protesters gathered in cities around the US on May 10 1972 to demonstrate against the use of mines in Vietnam harbors [@ArgusLeader1972_05_11a].
In Minneapolis, crowds totalling a thousand protestered gathered on and near the University of Minnesota campus and police responded with chemical weapons deployed via grenades, sprays, a helicopter and a thermal fogger [@ArgusLeader1972_05_11b; @StarTribune1972_05_11].

The fogger was used to direct the crowd around campus and spread gas over large areas, such as the area known as Scholars Walk (~0.25 mile from Washington Avenue to the Auditorium) [@StarTribune1972_05_11].


## Gainesville  {-}

Similarly to the anti-mine protests in [Minneapolis](#Minneapolis1972_05_10), on the campus of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida Highway Patrol deployed a riot vehicle dubbed "The Monster" which "spewed tear gas" [@ArgusLeader1972_05_11b].
Although a fogger is not mentioned specifically, this is the same agency (Florida Highway Patrol) that first [deployed thermal foggers via a truck](Liberty City #MiamiFL1968_08_08) in 1968 [@Tschenschlok1995; @Lorentzen2018].
