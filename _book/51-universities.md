# Universities {-}

Perhaps instigated by the willingness of the California Highway Patrol to use chemical weapons (including thermal foggers) in Berkeley on and around the University of California campus, many law enforcement agencies escalated anti-war and racial just protests in University towns during the 1960s and 1970s via chemical weapons.
The willingness of police to fog literally any place where undergraduates standing up for racial justice and against imperialism were gathering was highlighted in May of 1970 when Maryland State Police deployed chemical weapons via tear gas into the University of Maryland Chapel.


## Durham NC, February 13 1969 {-}

Durham Police broke up the "Allen Building Demonstration" on the campus of Duke University in Durham using a variety of weapons, including a thermal fogger [@DMH1969; @Schreiberetal1971a; @Schreiberetal1971b].
The police reportedly chased protesters across campus with the fogger, including using it inside Duke Chapel [@Schreiberetal1971a; @Schreiberetal1971b].

Alameda County sheriffs deployed a pepper fogger on UC Berkeley's campus again during the "People's Park Riots" of 1969 [@LATimes1969; @Hayes1970].

The riot apparently started when the university tried to prevent individuals living on the street from a volunteer-run park they built on a lot owned by the school [@ThePressDemocrat1970_10_13].




## Seattle WA, August 14 1969 {-}

Seattle police deployed CN and CS gas via a new pepper fogger in their clash with "hundreds of unruly youths in the University District" [@StatesmanJournal1969_08_17].

## College Park MD  May 4 1970 {- #CollegeParkMD1970_05_}

On May 4th, students gathered at campuses around the country to protest President Nixon's expansion of war into Cambodia, inlcuding in at the University of MAryland (UMD) campus in College Park [@WAS2013].
Police responded with chemical weapons that did not deter the protest, but rather moved it around the campus [@Cabe1970].
By later in the day, UMD students had heard about the Ohio National Guard shooting four Kent State students and took up a position in front on and inside the UMD Chapel [@WAS2013], which did not stop the chemical weapons barrage or the use of the fogger specifically [@Oates1970]

## Iowa City IA, May 6 1971 {-}

Johnson County sheriffs used chemical weapons against protesters in Iowa City, including two deputies carrying pepper foggers [@Eckholt1971].

The chemicals deployed smelled like insecticides and were described in print as "unidentified" because the Sheriff refused to identify the compounds [@Eckholt1971].



## Minneapolis MN, May 10 1972  {-}

Thousands of anti-war protesters gathered in cities around the US to demonstrate against the use of mines in Vietnam harbors [@ArgusLeader1972_05_11a].
