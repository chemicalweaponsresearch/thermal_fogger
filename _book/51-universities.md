# Universities {-}

Perhaps instigated by the willingness of the California Highway Patrol to use chemical weapons (including thermal foggers) in Berkeley on and around the University of California campus, many law enforcement agencies escalated campus protests in the 1960s and 1970s via chemical weapons.
The willingness of police to fog literally any place was highlighted in May of 1970 when Maryland State Police deployed chemical weapons via tear gas into the University of Maryland Chapel.


## Durham NC, February 13 1969 {-}

Durham Police broke up the "Allen Building Demonstration" on the campus of Duke University in Durham using a variety of weapons, including a thermal fogger [@DMH1969; @Schreiberetal1971a; @Schreiberetal1971b].
