# High Schools {-}

Almost immediately, law enforcement extended use of foggers from [universities]{#Universities} to high schools, specifically using the weapons against Black youth protesters.

I will stop to repeat that again so that we can all (myself included).

Law enforcement agencies used chemical weapons against Black junior and high school students during the Civil Rights Era, including a weapon (the thermal fogger) developed not even five years prior to [gas Vietnamese soldiers and civilians from tunnels](#Vietnam).

This event appears credible, given the much more documented deployment on December 3, 1971.
On that day, a combination of San Bernardino police, San Bernardino County sheriffs, and California Highway Patrol used tear gas from a pepper fogger to break up a "major racial confrontation" among students at San Gorgonio High School and across a 20-block area surrounding campus [@Yetzeretal1971].



## Lawrence {- #Lawrence1970_04_21}

Lawrence, Kansas Police used tear gas, including from a thermal fogger, on April 21st, 1970 against Black high school and junior high students, their parents, and community members [@Monhollon2002].
The students had gathered that day after a week-long stand-off with administration in response to their failures to meet their demands regarding Black representation in curriculum, hiring, sports, and awards [@Monhollon2002].

Black students had occuppied the principal's office on May 13th and prominent members of the office occupation were arrested from the school that day and promptly suspended from school [@Monhollon2002].
Racial tensions escalated over the subsequent week flamed by presence and actions of the local Klu Klux Klan and Minutemen, some of whom were also police officers [@Monhollon2002].
The night of April 20th, the school board held a meeting where they barred suspended students from participating and did not reinstate them, nor did they address the demands, and there was a mass walkout [@Monhollon2002].

The next day, police were ready with heavy chemical weaponry, including the [GOEC Pepper Fog](#GOEC) fogger:
