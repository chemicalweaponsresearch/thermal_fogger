# 1975 New Years Eve {-}

## Ft Lauderdale FL, December 31 1975  {-}

New Year's Eve 1975 was apparently quite raucous in Florida, as many cities experienced celebrations that got out-of-hand enough to elicit police use of force [@UPI1976].
In Ft. Lauderdale, revelers pulled down at traffic light and police deployed multiple foggers on a crowd of 2,500 on the beach [@UPI1976].

The mayhem was noteworthy enough to garner publication in the Berkeley Gazette (Berkeley, California) as well as the Tampa Tribune (Tampa, Florida) [@UPI1976].





## Bullitt KY, December 15 1981 {-}

Although not an intentional deployment, in at least one documented incident, a pepper fogger used in firefighter training exercises caused severe symptoms and led to an investigation [@Judd1981].
The Southeast Bullitt Volunteer Fire Department In Kentucky was conducting a smoke training exercise using a pepper fogger on loan from the fire marshal's office when their "victim" and 16 others (including firefighters) began experiencing coughing fits, headaches, and chest pains [@Judd1981].

Although Smith and Wesson (the Pepper Fogger manufacturer at the time) claimed this was a one-off incident, the Kentucky State Fire Marshal's office had received other reports of firefighters becoming sick when using foggers in smoke training [@Judd1981]. 
Residue tests later revealed no unexpected compounds [@Courier-Journal1982], indicating the toxicity had come from the design-for-use "safe" smoke.




## North Kingstown RI, March 22 1982 {-}

The Brown and Sharpe company called in local police and Rhode Island State Police officers to help try to break a (at the time) 22-long strike at their factory in North Kigston, Rhode Island [@AP1982; @Carbone2017]. 
A North Kingstown officer named TJ Varone deployed tear gas via a pepper fogger on a group of 75 people, primarily workers' wives and Brown University students, that was blocking the main entrance to the tool factory  [@AP1982; @Carbone2017].
The picketers braved the gas for a considerable amount of time, requiring close-range fogging to finally disperse them [@Carbone2017].

The fogging did not, however, break the strike [@Carbone2017].

Newspaper and television coverage of the fogging circled the globe [@Carbone2017].
