Another common target of police force are labor activists, and so it is not suprising to see the fogger being deployed against strikers at least once in US history.

### North Kingstown RI, March 22 1982 {-}

The Brown and Sharpe company called in local police and Rhode Island State Police officers to help try to break a (at the time) 22-long strike at their factory in North Kingstown, Rhode Island [@TheLexingtonHerald1982_03_23; @Carbone2017]. 
A North Kingstown officer named TJ Varone deployed tear gas via a pepper fogger on a group of 75 people, primarily workers' wives and Brown University students, that was blocking the main entrance to the tool factory  [@TheLexingtonHerald1982_03_23; @Carbone2017].
The picketers braved the gas for a considerable amount of time, requiring close-range fogging to finally disperse them [@Carbone2017].

The fogging did not, however, break the strike [@Carbone2017].

Newspaper and television coverage of the fogging circled the globe [@Carbone2017].
