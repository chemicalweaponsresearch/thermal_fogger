# Deployments: Redux {-}

## Portland OR, July 29 2020 {-}

At the beginning of July 2020, then-president Trump deployed Department of Homeland Security agents to "protect" federal property in Portland, OR (Homeland Security 2020, Flanigan 2020, Trump 2020).
During the final days of the visible presence and response of federal agents in Summer 2020, they unveiled their thermal fogger, which has been identified through photos as an [IGEBA TF35](https://www.nixalite.com/product/igeba-tf-35) thermal fogger from Nixalite of America Inc.
This machine is designed and marketed for bird control, and while "_training tool for military/law enforcement_" is listed among its uses (Nixalite 2009a), its safety requirements explicitly state: 

> "_**19. Do not fog directly against persons...During operation keep distance of minimum [10 ft].**_"

(Nixalite 2009b).

In the front of the left side is an agent holding a plastic clear riot shield, through which you can see a patch that say 'Border Patrol Federal Agent' in yellow and some insignia patches as well. In the middle are the agents in camo, one with a hand on the shoulder of another who is operating a thermal fogger machine shooting gas through the fence. The machine is maybe four or five feet long and has a body not unlike a bush whacker with a two-cycle engine, but fueling a vaporizer instead of a rotor. The agent is holding the machine with their right hand visibly and there is a black strap across their shoulder holding it up. The machine is mostly shiny metal, although the tip is showing signs of corrosion (no surprise based on the compounds and heat) and the supports of the body are a bright green. source: https://twitter.com/dougbrown8/status/1288727075197657088/photo/1    " width="500"  style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />

## Portland OR, October 17 2020 {-}

While the thermal fogger hasn't been deployed at the Courthouse in Portland since July 29 2020, it has been used repeatedly by Department of Homeland Security agents at the private property US Immigration and Customs Enforcement rents to use as a holding center for deportees in South Waterfront neighborhood (Simonis, personal observation).

The first of such deployments occurred during the fall of 2020.

## Portland OR, January 20 2021 {-}

The same fogger (or at least the same model) was again brought out at the ICE rental property in response to a protester spray painting a piece of plywood tacked outside the building (Simonis, personal observation).

It is being held at hip height; the arm holding it is relaxed down. source: https://twitter.com/MaranieRae/status/1352394871080816641/photo/1    " width="500"  style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />

Two officers dressed in full protective gear with bulletproof vests holding supplies on, with the word POLICE stenciled in yellow. They are both wearing helmets and gas masks. The nearer one is holding a gas fogger in the right hand. Thefogger looks like a long tube between 3 and 4 feet long with a handle and motor parts near the back. The tube is covered with a wire cage until about the last half foot, which is a plain and narrower tube. Behind these two officers are some dimly lit buildings and one or two other officers but they are not clear. source: https://twitter.com/MathieuLRolland/status/1353427314348986373/photo/1     " width="500"  style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />
