    <img src="img/Crockett1969.png" width="500" alt="B/W image drawing with text from an old white paper book. The text says FOG DISSEMINATION at the top then a paragraph with `Fog dissemination devices operate by rapidly vaporizing a high boiling point liquid agent formulation. This is accomplished by injecting the liquid agent into a hot gas flow and allowing the vaporized agent to contact the cooler ambient air where the agent condenses into a fog and ultimately into extremely small agent particles.` In the middle is the drawing with a square on the left with a long rectangle coming out of it to the right with a cloud out the further end of the rectangle. There are bits of text around it, pointing to the box it says `FUEL`, `SPARK`, and `COMBUSTION CHAMBER`. in the middle of the rectange it says `HOT GASES` in the middle of arrows pointing out towards the cloud. Along the rectangle another injection area is noted for `Liquid Agent Injection` Text on the bottom says `FIGURE 4. FOG DISSEMINATION. A liquid chemical agent is vaporized by a hot gas flow and released as a fog cloud`." style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />
