<h2>Miami FL, August 8 1968</h2>
<p>The first use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons in the US that I have been able to uncover was during the â<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Miami_riot">Liberty City Riots</a>â, which took place in during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Republican_National_Convention">1968 Republican National Convention</a> (RNC) <span class="citation">(Tschenschlok <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>; McArdle <a href="references.html#ref-McArdle2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.
A white reporter with the Miami Herald attempted to gain access to rally of concerned Black people that was meant to be only among Black people that was occurring in Liberty City, a Black neighborhood, on August 7th <span class="citation">(Tschenschlok <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>.
When the reporter was ejected from the rally, Miami police responded with a large and heavy presence and during the standoff, a white motorist with a âWallace for Presidentâ bumper sticker attempted to drive through but was met with resistance and drove into another car, and fled the scene on foot <span class="citation">(Tschenschlok <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>; Lorentze <a href="references.html#ref-Lorentzen2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Miami police used chemical weapons the night of the 7th, but the fogger did not make an appearance until the subsequent day.
Local, state, and federal officials met with Black organizational representatives the night of the 7th and had agreed to continue discussions the morning of the 8th, but instead sent staffers rather than appear themselves, which effectively ended discussions <span class="citation">(Tschenschlok <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>.

<p>FHP used a truck with multiple foggers <span class="citation">(Lorentze <a href="references.html#ref-Lorentzen2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, described as âessentially a modified version of an insect-control machineâ that âspread a thick fog of tear gas throughout the riot zoneâ <span class="citation">(Tschenschlok <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>FHP used the truck-mounted thermal foggers indiscriminately and caused visible symptoms (gagging, etc.) in all present, including a 5-month old <span class="citation">(McArdle <a href="references.html#ref-McArdle2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.
The fog quickly spread into neighborhood homes, forcing residents outside to seek fresh air <span class="citation">(Tschenschlok <a href="references.html#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2>McAlester OK, May 20 1974</h2>
<p>Like many chemical weapons devices, thermal foggers are used in the carceral system, but unfortunately most deployments go undocumented or their documents never see the light of day.
It seems that the only time we find out about prisoners being fogged is when a serious incident occurs triggering outside investigations and the judicial system.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the McAlester (âBig Macâ) Oklahoma State Penitentiary was the site of considerable resistance and rioting by inmates <span class="citation">(Rag <a href="references.html#ref-TheRag1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>; Soldier <a href="references.html#ref-WinterSoldier1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span>.
A major tool used by the guards in retaliation was tear gas, which they deployed via shot shells, grenades, and pepper foggers <span class="citation">(Allen, <a href="references.html#ref-Allen1974a" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Allen1974a" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Allen1975a" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Allen1975a" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Allen1975b" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Allen1975b" role="doc-biblioref">d</a>; Coffey, <a href="references.html#ref-Coffey1975b" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Coffey1975b" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>.

<p>The guards regularly isolated the uprisingâs leaders in the solitary confinement building known as âThe Rockâ, sealed the building, and gassed it so thick it lasted for days <span class="citation">(Allen, <a href="references.html#ref-Allen1974b" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Allen1974b" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>; Rag <a href="references.html#ref-TheRag1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span>.
During the May 20 gassings in response to riots, Black prisoner Robert Forsythe, a 33-year old serving time for a robbery, happened to be in solitary confinement due to being caught with contraband money and was not associated with the uprising direclty, and so inexperienced with the effects of gas <span class="citation">(Johnson <a href="references.html#ref-Johnson1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>; Rag <a href="references.html#ref-TheRag1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>; Wilson <a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>.

<p>During the gassings, a pepper fogger was specifically used in the building and created âfumes of gas [that] were awfully heavy, one of the worst Iâve ever seenâ according to veteran corrections officersâ trial testimony <span class="citation">(Allen, <a href="references.html#ref-Allen1975b" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Allen1975b" role="doc-biblioref">d</a>; Coffey, <a href="references.html#ref-Coffey1975a" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a><a href="references.html#ref-Coffey1975a" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>.
