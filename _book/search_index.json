I come to the study of the history of chemical weapons use in America via my personal experience being the recipient of law enforcements chemical weapons and my ensuing scientific research into its impacts on the environment. I have a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Cornell, where I studied aquatic ecology and biogeochemistry  disciplines I have put to use to studying the impact of chemical weapons. Through my ecological research, I have uncovered historical and current information into the impacts of chemical weapons that I was not seeing being represented in the present day broad cultural discourse. From this need to share historical information came this booklet, a concise way for me to pass along a window into the racist, classist, capitalistic, and colonialistic throughline of the thermal fogger. I am an abolitionist in multiple senses: I believe that the use of chemical weapons, police, and the carceral system should all be abolished, full-stop.

In the front of the left side is an agent holding a plastic clear riot shield, through which you can see a patch that say &#39;Border Patrol Federal Agent&#39; in yellow and some insignia patches as well. In the middle are the agents in camo, one with a hand on the shoulder of another who is operating a thermal fogger machine shooting gas through the fence. The machine is maybe four or five feet long and has a body not unlike a bush whacker with a two-cycle engine, but fueling a vaporizer instead of a rotor. The agent is holding the machine with their right hand visibly and there is a black strap across their shoulder holding it up. The machine is mostly shiny metal, although the tip is showing signs of corrosion (no surprise based on the compounds and heat) and the supports of the body are a bright green. source: https://twitter.com/dougbrown8/status/1288727075197657088/photo/1.&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 1em 0 1em&quot; /&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; Portland OR, 7/29/2020 [@Brown2020] &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; In doing so, DHS made a large swath of the populace aware of an insidious weapon that was birthed in the American occupation of Vietnam, perfected for use against domestic protesters in the 1960s and 70s, and sent abroad via US Border Patrol in the years since. The subsequent return of the thermal fogger to use against civilians domestically by the same agency (Border Patrol) using it abroad is an extension of the classical Imperialist Boomerang (CÃ©saire 1950; Arendt 1951; Foucault 1976; Graham 2013) that can be more aptly described as a tetherball. Despite repeated use of thermal foggers to deploy chemical weapons over the last half century, the device appears to have slipped from the zeitgeist, only to reemerge in the city which experienced the most visible novel federal deployment of chemical weapons (Flanigan 2020), the most chemical weapons-based incidents of police brutality at racial justice protests across American cities (regardless of population size) (PB2020 Team 2021), and an notable density of photographers and videographers. Not all of the weapons history is documented, but enough is that we can dispel the myth that this deployment was new in any notable sense other than being recent. Indeed, through this work, I have discovered an extensive history of its deployment and can say that I feel a deep connection to my protest elders who experienced thermal foggers decades ago, and I hope that my work will bring light to their stories. We are but the most recent chapter in a long history of United States Law Enforcement using chemical weapons against its own people. "],["vietnam.html", "Vietnam", " Vietnam The modern day use of thermal foggers for chemical weapons deployment was born from the American colonization of Vietnam in the mid-to-late-20th Century (Bunker 1996). "],["context.html", "Context", " Context Early on in the deployment of US troops to occupy Vietnam, the need for large scale mosquito control became so great that soldiers began improvising insecticide foggers by mounting pesticide sprayers to diesel truck exhaust (Spicknall 1969). The hack turned out to be much more effective, covering nine square miles per day, compared to 50,000 square feet (0.002 square miles) per day using a conventional manually operated fogger (Spicknall 1969). As the occupation continued, US Army Soldiers were tasked with rooting out Viet Cong and Peoples Army of Vietnam soldiers, as well as innocents, from tunnels. The specialized forces designated for the work were dubbed Tunnel Rats and tear gas was part of their arsenal to flush individuals from caves, which they regularly deployed via pyrotechnic grenades and powdered explosives (Faas 1977; Rottman 2006; Hemmings 2019). &lt;figure&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;img/rat_mask.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;B/W image.

On the first day of the operation (October 8th), the force located a tunnel and set into motion an elaborate scheme to fog the tunnels with hexachloroethane (HC) smoke from burning pots, marking the first known tactical use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons agents (USMACV 1965; Rottman and Delf 2012). Overall, the endeavor was dubbed a success in the report distributed the next month, despite the tunnel having been empty already (USMACV 1965). And although (highly toxic; Simonis (2020)) munitions smoke was used in this application, it was noted that tear gas would be very effective in flushing VC from tunnels should there been any present (USMACV 1965). &lt;figure&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;img/mity_mite.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Technical rendering sketch of a tank with the words Mity Mite on the side.

Indeed, it took just three years from initial deployment in Vietnam on October 8 1965 to first application in the United States to gas Black racial justice protesters in Miami, Florida on August 8th, 1968 during the Liberty City Riots (Tschenschlok 1995; Lorentze 2018). In alignment with the general Imperial Circuit of Tear Gas (Schrader, n.d.) between the US and Vietnam, the return of the fogger was aided significantly by the weapons industry, militarization of US police forces, the transition of veterans to law enforcement occupations upon returning home, and substantial propaganda in a variety of specialized and generalized outlets.

Colonel named Rex Applegate. Applegate took a commission as a second leuitenant, but had a lung ailment kept him from serving in combat in World War II and so was assigned to Military Police Company before being tapped by Col. William Donovan to build and run the School for Spies and Assassins in the Office of Strategic Services (Goldstein 1998). Larger than life, Rex even served as bodyguard to President Franklin Roosevelt, before retiring and moving to Mexico at the end of World War II to consult with Central and South American governments on riot control (Goldstein 1998). Applegate returned to the US in the 1960s during the civil rights and anti-war protest era and began proselytizing the good word of the thermal fogger (Applegate 1969, 1970). Indeed, Rex published what can only be described as a long-form written sales pitch for the GOEC Pepper Fog thermal fogger in the highly circulated Guns magazine in 1970 (Applegate 1970). &lt;figure&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;img/demo.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Black and white photo of a person using a pepper fogger across some railroad tracks.

For example, Pulitzer Prize-winning Garry Wills (who at the time was considerably more conservative than he came to be later) penned an op-ed that ran in (at least) The Herald Statesman (Yonkers, New York) (Wills 1971a), The Daily Item (Port Chester, New York) (Wills 1971b), The Charlotte News (Charlotte, North Carolina) (Wills 1971c), and The Philadelphia Inquirer (Wills 1971d) in April 1971 in which he basically tells all the cry babies (pun intended) to suck it up because he would not be afraid to undergo such experiences [as being pepper fogged] again (Wills 1971a). Notably, he touts the leading belief at the time that somehow thermal fogging is a safe immobilizer of individuals (Wills 1971a), despite the weapon not being demonstrably safer than gas grenades and not only not immobilizing but explicitly designed to mobilize immobile resisters. Interesting, Wills compares indiscriminate and uncontrollable chemical weapons as safer than dogs, which get out of control, bit bystanders (and even other cops) as well as the bad guys (Wills 1971a). He concludes his piece by calling tear gas humane in  foreign wars [and] domestic encounters (Wills 1971a), speaking clearly to the return, classically defining an Imperial Boomerang (CÃ©saire 1950; Arendt 1951; Foucault 1976).

"],["MiamiFL1968-08-08.html", "Miami FL, August 8 1968", " Miami FL, August 8 1968 The first use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons in the US that I have been able to uncover was during the Liberty City Riots, which took place in during the 1968 Republican National Convention (RNC) (Tschenschlok 1995, 1996; McArdle 2018). A white reporter with the Miami Herald attempted to gain access to rally of concerned Black people that was meant to be only among Black people that was occurring in Liberty City, a Black neighborhood, on August 7th (Tschenschlok 1995, 1996). When the reporter was ejected from the rally, Miami police responded with a large and heavy presence and during the standoff, a white motorist with a Wallace for President bumper sticker attempted to drive through but was met with resistance and drove into another car, and fled the scene on foot (Tschenschlok 1995; Lorentze 2018). Miami police used chemical weapons the night of the 7th, but the fogger did not make an appearance until the subsequent day. Local, state, and federal officials met with Black organizational representatives the night of the 7th and had agreed to continue discussions the morning of the 8th, but instead sent staffers rather than appear themselves, which effectively ended discussions (Tschenschlok 1995, 1996). Apparently, Miami Police Department was unable to manage the situation and Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) was called in by the city (Tschenschlok 1995). FHP used a truck with multiple foggers (Lorentze 2018), described as essentially a modified version of an insect-control machine that spread a thick fog of tear gas throughout the riot zone (Tschenschlok 1995). FHP used the truck-mounted thermal foggers indiscriminately and caused visible symptoms (gagging, etc.) in all present, including a 5-month old (McArdle 2018). The fog quickly spread into neighborhood homes, forcing residents outside to seek fresh air (Tschenschlok 1995).

After four days, hundreds had been given medical assistance for exposure to chemical weapons (Taylor and Morris 2018). Although I have yet to find contemporary documentation of fogger use during the convention, an AP report on fogger use in Berkeley the year later states A similar device was used during demonstrations in Chicago during the Democratic convention last summer.

It seems that the only time we find out about prisoners being fogged is when a serious incident occurs triggering outside investigations and the judicial system. In the 1970s, the McAlester (Big Mac) Oklahoma State Penitentiary was the site of considerable resistance and rioting by inmates (Rag 1975; Soldier 1975). A major tool used by the guards in retaliation was tear gas, which they deployed via shot shells, grenades, and pepper foggers (Allen, n.d.a, n.d.b, n.d.d; Coffey, n.d.a). Given its use here, it is highly likely that the Oklahoma State Penitentiary systen used pepper foggers before (and likely after) (Johnson 1974). The guards regularly isolated the uprisings leaders in the solitary confinement building known as The Rock, sealed the building, and gassed it so thick it lasted for days (Allen, n.d.c; Rag 1975). During the May 20 gassings in response to riots, Black prisoner Robert Forsythe, a 33-year old serving time for a robbery, happened to be in solitary confinement due to being caught with contraband money and was not associated with the uprising direclty, and so inexperienced with the effects of gas (Johnson 1974; Rag 1975; Wilson 1993). Although reports are conflicting on details, guards started fogging and gassing prisoners who were, at most, rattling their doors (Hobbs 1974). The likely reason for the barrage was retaliatory, as it was unjustified according to a veteran guard (Coffey, n.d.b). During the gassings, a pepper fogger was specifically used in the building and created fumes of gas [that] were awfully heavy, one of the worst Ive ever seen according to veteran corrections officers trial testimony (Allen, n.d.d; Coffey, n.d.b). The gassing lasted for four hours despite yells for help, resulting in serious injuries including burned and blistered skin, eyes swollen shut, and breathing difficulties (Coffey, n.d.a). That intense fogging and lack of medical attention over the next two days were main factors contributing to Forsythes injuries and death two days later, according to medical experts testimony (Allen, n.d.c, n.d.b, n.d.d). Although the guards involved were indicted by a grand jury and brought to trial, they ultimately were acquitted of all charges (United Press International 1975b, 1975a).
