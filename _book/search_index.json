Chemical weapons are a common tool among oppressive regimes, including colonizing forces. The events cataloged in this book occur at many locations across the present-day USA and internationally, including Mexico and Vietnam. Content Warning This booklet deals with police and corrections violence in frank terminology. Pictures of chemical weapons being deployed on individuals, including those passively resisting, are included. Casualties and fatalities are discussed. Inherent Bias This book has been produced by collating historical documentation and records, which are inherently biased, as will be plainly evident in the documents. As such, it is important to recognize that there are likely records that have not yet been found by the researchers or which have been lost to time, and even more substantially it is critical to be clear about the fact that many uses of thermal foggers have likely never been recorded, as too will be made clear through the documents that have been recovered. Author Position I, Dr. Juniper L. Simonis (they/them/theirs), am a 36-year-old middle-class, white, non-binary, queer, physically and psychologically disabled person. I come to the study of the history of chemical weapons use in America via my personal experience being the recipient of law enforcements chemical weapons and my ensuing scientific research into its impacts on the environment. I have a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Cornell, where I studied aquatic ecology and biogeochemistry  disciplines I have put to use to studying the impact of chemical weapons. Through my ecological research, I have uncovered historical and current information into the impacts of chemical weapons that I was not seeing being represented in the present day broad cultural discourse. From this need to share historical information came this booklet, a concise way for me to pass along a window into the racist, classist, capitalistic, and colonialistic throughline of the thermal fogger. I am an abolitionist in multiple senses: I believe that the use of chemical weapons, police, and the carceral system should all be abolished, full-stop. Financial Statement All work for this product was conducted by Dr. Juniper L. Simonis via internal time at DAPPER Stats. No external funding was provided. Acknowledgments My deepest heartfelt condolences to the family of Robert Forsythe. I cannot even begin to imagine the impact Bobbys murder and the subsequent trial and media presence had on you and your community. I hope that by shining a light on his story now, more people will come to understand just how horrendous the prison system is and fight for its abolition. This booklet is based on a variety of sources (cited within) past and present, and to the journalists and photographers: thank you for sharing your work with the world. I have no idea how many people have been involved in digitizing historical newspapers, as their names are never on anything, but yall are fantastic and I appreciate you so much. Sandra Simonis provided significant help with writing alt-text for images. Twitter users NewNameJeanette and WillHickox notified me of the Lawrence High School protest and use of the thermal fogger, for which I am very thankful.

"],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction On July 29th, 2020 federal agents of the Department of Homeland Security deployed unknown chemical agents via a thermal fogger on racial justice protesters outside the Hatfield Federal Courthouse in Portland, Oregon. Portland OR, 7/29/2020 (Brown 2020) In doing so, DHS made a large swath of the populace aware of an insidious weapon that was birthed in the American occupation of Vietnam, perfected for use against domestic protesters in the 1960s and 70s, and sent abroad via US Border Patrol in the years since. The subsequent return of the thermal fogger to use against civilians domestically by the same domestic law enforcement agency (Border Patrol) that sent it abroad after its initial domestic use is an extension of the classical Imperialist Boomerang (Césaire 1950; Arendt 1951; Foucault 1976; Graham 2013) that can be more aptly described as a tetherball. Despite repeated use of thermal foggers to deploy chemical weapons over the last half century, the device appears to have slipped from the zeitgeist, only to reemerge in the city which experienced the most visible novel federal deployment of chemical weapons (Flanigan 2020), the most chemical weapons-based incidents of police brutality at racial justice protests across American cities (regardless of population size) (PB2020 Team 2021), and an notable density of photographers and videographers. Not all of the weapons history is documented, but enough is that we can dispel the myth that this deployment was new in any notable sense other than being recent. Indeed, through this work, I have discovered an extensive history of its deployment and can say that I feel a deep connection to my protest elders who experienced thermal foggers decades ago, and I hope that my work will bring light to their stories. We are but the most recent chapter in a long history of United States Law Enforcement using chemical weapons against its own people. "],["Vietnam.html", "Vietnam", " Vietnam The modern day use of thermal foggers for chemical weapons deployment was born from the American colonization of Vietnam in the mid-to-late-20th Century (Bunker 1996). "],["context.html", "Context", " Context Early on in the deployment of US troops to occupy Vietnam, the need for large scale mosquito control became so great that soldiers began improvising insecticide foggers by mounting pesticide sprayers to diesel truck exhaust (Spicknall 1969). The hack turned out to be much more effective, covering nine square miles per day, compared to 50,000 square feet (0.002 square miles) per day using a conventional manually operated fogger (Spicknall 1969). As the occupation continued, US Army Soldiers were tasked with rooting out Viet Cong and Peoples Army of Vietnam soldiers, as well as innocents, from tunnels. The specialized forces designated for the work were dubbed Tunnel Rats and tear gas was part of their arsenal to flush individuals from caves, which they regularly deployed via pyrotechnic grenades and powdered explosives (Faas 1977; Rottman 2006; Hemmings 2019). Tunnel rat in a gas mask, undated (Hemmings 2019). "],["Genesis.html", "Genesis", " Genesis In 1965, the US Chemical Advisor to the South Vietnamese Armys (ARVN) III Corps participated in planning a search and destroy operation in the Iron Triangle, which was known to house an elaborate Viet Cong tunnel system, and suggested using a Mity Mite fogger to aid in clearing tunnels (USMACV 1965). On the first day of the operation (October 8th), the force located a tunnel and set into motion an elaborate scheme to fog the tunnels with hexachloroethane (HC) smoke from burning pots, marking the first known tactical use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons agents (USMACV 1965; Rottman and Delf 2012). Overall, the endeavor was dubbed a success in the report distributed the next month, despite the tunnel having been empty already (USMACV 1965). And although (highly toxic; Simonis (2020)) munitions smoke was used in this application, it was noted that tear gas would be very effective in flushing VC from tunnels should there been any present (USMACV 1965). (USMACV 1965). "],["expansion.html", "Expansion", " Expansion The practice caught on quickly, and Mity Mites were soon issued to ARVN units (USMACV 1965) and became common tools for Tunnel Rats (Rottman and Delf 2012). The United States military was publishing on the utility of the fogger in official journals by the next year (US Army 1966). A soldier uses a backpack Mity Mite to fog a tunnel, undated (US Army 1966). The Army used foggers to pump air or smoke into tunnels in combination with riot control agents during Operation Cedar falls in 1967 (Lehrer 1968). And by 1968s Battle of Khe Sanh, it was standard practice to use foggers for tunnel excavation as well as mosquito and fly control (Rottman 2006).

"],["TheReturn.html", "The Return", " The Return As to be expected following the basic trajectory of an Imperial Boomerang (Césaire 1950; Arendt 1951; Foucault 1976), the repressive technique (thermal fogging) developed by an imperialist country (USA) to control colonial territories (Vietnam) was brought home by the imperialist nation to use on its own people (Graham 2013). Indeed, it took just three years from initial deployment in Vietnam on October 8 1965 to first application in the United States to gas Black racial justice protesters in Miami, Florida on August 8th, 1968 during the Liberty City Riots (Tschenschlok 1995; Lorentze 2018). In alignment with the general Imperial Circuit of Tear Gas (Schrader 2019) between the US and Vietnam, the return of the fogger was aided significantly by the weapons industry, militarization of US police forces, the transition of veterans to law enforcement occupations upon returning home, and substantial propaganda in a variety of specialized and generalized outlets. "],["GOEC.html", "General Ordnance Equipment Corporation", " General Ordnance Equipment Corporation The General Ordnance Equipment Corporation (GOEC), who developed and trademarked Chemical Mace the year prior, began using the phrase Pepper Fog in July 1968 on their thermal fogger line and applied for a trademark on the phrase in October of the same year (USTPO 2018).

"],["rex-applegate.html", "Rex Applegate", " Rex Applegate A major figure in the translation of military riot suppression tactics to domestic law enforcement in the 1960s and 1970s was a former US Army Lt. Colonel named Rex Applegate. Applegate took a commission as a second leuitenant, but had a lung ailment kept him from serving in combat in World War II and so was assigned to Military Police Company before being tapped by Col. William Donovan to build and run the School for Spies and Assassins in the Office of Strategic Services (Goldstein 1998). Larger than life, Rex even served as bodyguard to President Franklin Roosevelt, before retiring and moving to Mexico at the end of World War II to consult with Central and South American governments on riot control (Goldstein 1998). Applegate returned to the US in the 1960s during the civil rights and anti-war protest era and began proselytizing the good word of the thermal fogger (Applegate 1969, 1970). Indeed, Rex published what can only be described as a long-form written sales pitch for the GOEC Pepper Fog thermal fogger in the highly circulated Guns magazine in 1970 (Applegate 1970).

"],["gary-wills.html", "Gary Wills", " Gary Wills Alongside the more overtly pro-police-use-of-chemical-weapons propaganda of Rex Applegate were other, perhaps more subtle forms. For example, Pulitzer Prize-winning Garry Wills (who at the time was considerably more conservative than he came to be later) penned an op-ed that ran in (at least) The Herald Statesman (Yonkers, New York) (Wills 1971a), The Daily Item (Port Chester, New York) (Wills 1971b), The Charlotte News (Charlotte, North Carolina) (Wills 1971c), and The Philadelphia Inquirer (Wills 1971d) in April 1971 in which he basically tells all the cry babies (pun intended) to suck it up because he would not be afraid to undergo such experiences [as being pepper fogged] again (Wills 1971a). Notably, he touts the leading belief at the time that somehow thermal fogging is a safe immobilizer of individuals (Wills 1971a), despite the weapon not being demonstrably safer than gas grenades and not only not immobilizing but explicitly designed to mobilize immobile resisters. Interesting, Wills compares indiscriminate and uncontrollable chemical weapons as safer than dogs, which get out of control, bit bystanders (and even other cops) as well as the bad guys (Wills 1971a). He concludes his piece by calling tear gas humane in  foreign wars [and] domestic encounters (Wills 1971a), speaking clearly to the return, classically defining an Imperial Boomerang (Césaire 1950; Arendt 1951; Foucault 1976). "],["the-1968-conventions.html", "The 1968 Conventions", " The 1968 Conventions Deployment of chemical weapons on United States civilians by domestic law enforcement began in earnest in the late 1960s during the height of anti-war and civil rights protests, kicked off in particular by the 1968 Republican (Miami, Florida) and Democratic (Chicago, IL) National Conventions (McArdle 2018; Taylor and Morris 2018). As a result of a heavy propaganda and branding campaign, the thermal fogger was becoming a mainstay of early police chemical weapons arsenals. Importantly, by the summer of 1968, the Florida Highway Patrol, Chicago Police Department, and California State Police all had purchased foggers. "],["MiamiFL1968-08-08.html", "Miami August 8", " Miami August 8 The first use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons in the US that I have been able to uncover was during the Liberty City Riots, which took place in during the 1968 Republican National Convention (RNC) in Miami, Florida (Tschenschlok 1995, 1996; McArdle 2018). A white reporter with the Miami Herald attempted to gain access to rally of concerned Black people that was meant to be only among Black people that was occurring in Liberty City, a Black neighborhood, on August 7th (Tschenschlok 1995, 1996). When the reporter was ejected from the rally, Miami police responded with a large and heavy presence and during the standoff, a white motorist with a Wallace for President bumper sticker attempted to drive through but was met with resistance and drove into another car, and fled the scene on foot (Tschenschlok 1995; Lorentze 2018). Miami police used chemical weapons the night of the 7th, but the fogger did not make an appearance until the subsequent day. Local, state, and federal officials met with Black organizational representatives the night of the 7th and had agreed to continue discussions the morning of the 8th, but instead sent staffers rather than appear themselves, which effectively ended discussions (Tschenschlok 1995, 1996). Apparently, Miami Police Department was unable to manage the situation and Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) was called in by the city (Tschenschlok 1995). FHP used a truck with multiple foggers (Lorentze 2018), described as essentially a modified version of an insect-control machine that spread a thick fog of tear gas throughout the riot zone (Tschenschlok 1995). FHP used the truck-mounted thermal foggers indiscriminately and caused visible symptoms (gagging, etc.) in all present, including a 5-month old (McArdle 2018). The fog quickly spread into neighborhood homes, forcing residents outside to seek fresh air (Tschenschlok 1995).

After four days, hundreds had been given medical assistance for exposure to chemical weapons (Taylor and Morris 2018). Although I have yet to find contemporary documentation of fogger use during the convention, an AP report on fogger use in Berkeley the year later states A similar device was used during demonstrations in Chicago during the Democratic convention last summer.

In Ft. Lauderdale, party-goers pulled down a traffic light and police deployed multiple foggers on a crowd of 2,500 on the beach (United Press International 1976a). Police carrying pepper foggers towards a crowd in the street, Ft Lauderdale, FL 12/31/1975 (United Press International 1975a). The mayhem was noteworthy enough to garner publication in the Berkeley Gazette (United Press International 1976b) as well as the Tampa Tribune (United Press International 1976a). 1974 NHRA Nationals Indiana State Police used a pepper fogger and gas grenades on a crowd of 2,000 drag racing fans blocking a highway between the track and campsites at the Hot Rod Associations US Nationals in Clermont IN, September 1 1974 (Associated Press 1974b, 1974a). "],["the-carceral-system.html", "The Carceral System", " The Carceral System Like many chemical weapons devices, thermal foggers are used in local, state, and federal carceral systems. Unfortunately most deployments go undocumented or such documents never see the light of day. It seems that the only time we find out about prisoners being fogged is when a serious incident occurs triggering outside investigations and the judicial system. "],["big-mac.html", "Big Mac", " Big Mac In the 1970s, the McAlester (Big Mac) Oklahoma State Penitentiary was the site of considerable resistance and rioting by inmates (Rag 1975; Soldier 1975). A major tool used by the guards in retaliation was tear gas, which they deployed via shot shells, grenades, and pepper foggers (Allen 1974a, 1975a, 1975b; Coffey 1975b). Given its use here, it is highly likely that the Oklahoma State Penitentiary system used pepper foggers before (and likely after) (Johnson 1974). The guards regularly isolated the uprisings leaders in the solitary confinement building known as The Rock, sealed the building, and gassed it so thick it lasted for days (Allen 1974b; Rag 1975). During the May 20 1974 gassings in response to riots, Black prisoner Robert Forsythe, a 33-year old serving time for a robbery, happened to be in solitary confinement due to being caught with contraband money and was not associated with the uprising directly, and so inexperienced with the effects of gas (Johnson 1974; Rag 1975; Wilson 1993). Although reports are conflicting on details, guards started fogging and gassing prisoners who were, at most, rattling their doors (Hobbs 1974). The likely reason for the barrage was retaliatory, as it was unjustified according to a veteran guard (Coffey 1975a). During the gassings, a pepper fogger was specifically used in the building and created fumes of gas [that] were awfully heavy, one of the worst Ive ever seen according to veteran corrections officers trial testimony (Allen 1975b; Coffey 1975a). The gassing lasted for four hours despite yells for help, resulting in serious injuries including burned and blistered skin, eyes swollen shut, and breathing difficulties (Coffey 1975b). That intense fogging and lack of medical attention over the next two days were main factors contributing to Forsythes injuries and death two days later, according to medical experts testimony (Allen 1974b, 1975a, 1975b). Although the guards involved were indicted by a grand jury and brought to trial, they ultimately were acquitted of all charges (United Press International 1975c, 1975b). "],["union-correctional.html", "Union Correctional", " Union Correctional According to the superintendent, a riot was caused in the Florida State Prisons Union Correctional Institution in Raiford on July 5th, 1981 by 22 prisoners who were intoxicated, and the only way to subdue them was to deploy a thermal fogger (United Press International 1981). As a result of two officers being slightly injured and three inmates being stabbed, an investigation was launched that caused the event to be picked up in the newspapers (United Press International 1981). "],["dade-county.html", "Dade County", " Dade County Dade County Sheriffs used foggers to sweep a field on July 17th 1974 in search of a murder suspect that had eluded K-9 units, helicopters, a plane, and an attempt to flush him out by burning the field (Associated Press and United Press International 1974). The suspect was so well dug in that he could withstand significant gassing that surprised a Sheriffs sergeant who participated in the operation (Associated Press and United Press International 1974). "],["training.html", "Training", " Training Bullitt Volunteer Fire Deptartment While not an intentional deployment, in at least one documented incident, a pepper fogger used in firefighter training exercises caused severe symptoms and led to an investigation (Judd 1981). On December 15 1981, The Southeast Bullitt Volunteer Fire Department In Kentucky was conducting a smoke training exercise using a pepper fogger on loan from the fire marshals office when their victim and 16 others (including firefighters) began experiencing coughing fits, headaches, and chest pains (Judd 1981). Although Smith and Wesson (the Pepper Fogger manufacturer at the time) claimed this was a one-off incident, the Kentucky State Fire Marshals office had received other reports of firefighters becoming sick when using foggers in smoke training (Judd 1981). Residue tests later revealed no unexpected compounds (Courier-Journal 1982), indicating the toxicity had come from the design-for-use safe smoke.
