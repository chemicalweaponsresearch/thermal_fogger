<h3 class="unnumbered">Content Warning</h3>
<p>This book deals with police and corrections violence in frank terminology. Pictures of chemical weapons being deployed on individuals, including those passively resisting, are included, but no injuries, blood, gore, etc. are shown. Casualties, including fatalities, are discussed, including an individual being killed by corrections officers.</p>
</div>
<div id="land-acknowledgment" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Land Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>This work’s impetus comes from present-day Portland, Oregon, United States of America – the Indigenous land of the Chinook people, who were colonized and spread across multiple federally recognized tribes in Oregon, Washington and Idaho including Cowlitz, Siletz, Wasco, and Yakima.</p>
<p>Chemical weapons are a common tool among imperialist regimes. The events cataloged in this book occur at many locations across the present-day United States and internationally, with specific references to Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam, where colonizing forces of (predominately Northwestern) Europe have used forced labor from enslaved Black people to impose significant force on Indigenous cultures and individuals.</p>
<p>No words can fully encompass the place in which each of the stories told in this book occur. I will work to add important contextual information and acknowledgments, and please remember that each use of a thermal fogger or other brutal police force described here impacted many, many lives.</p>
<p>I ask you to take time to reflect on the countless individuals from communities, tribes, peoples, and cultures around the world that have been fogged with some chemical agent whose names we will never know, whose stories we will never hear.</p>
</div>
<div id="inherent-bias" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Inherent Bias</h3>
<p>This book has been produced by collating historical documentation and records, which are inherently biased towards the views of white, male colonizers, as will be plainly evident in the documents. As such, it is important to recognize that there are almost certainly records that I have not yet found or which have been lost to time. Even more critical, however, is that many uses of thermal foggers have likely never been recorded at all (even if “legally required”), as will be made clear through the documents that have been recovered.</p>

<div id="author-position" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Author Position</h3>
<p>I, Dr. Juniper L. Simonis (<em>they/them/theirs</em>), am a 36-year-old middle-class, white, non-binary, queer, physically and psychologically disabled person. I come to the study of the history of chemical weapons use in America via my personal experience being the recipient of law enforcement’s chemical weapons and my ensuing scientific research into its impacts on the environment.</p>
<p>I have a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Cornell, where I studied aquatic ecology and biogeochemistry – disciplines I have put to use to studying the impact of chemical weapons. Through my ecological research, I have uncovered historical and current information into the impacts of chemical weapons that I was not seeing being represented in the present day broad cultural discourse.</p>
<p>From this need to share historical information came this book, a way for me to pass along a window into the racist, classist, capitalistic, and colonialistic throughline of the thermal fogger.</p>
<p>I am an abolitionist in multiple senses: I believe that the use of chemical weapons, police, and the carceral system should all be abolished, full-stop.</p>
<p>Through this work, I have discovered an extensive history that makes me feel a deep connection to my protest elders who experienced thermal foggers decades ago. I hope that my work will bring light to their stories. We are but the most recent chapter in a long history of United States Law Enforcement using chemical weapons against its own people.</p>

<p>My deepest heartfelt condolences to the family of Robert Forsythe. I cannot even begin to imagine the impact Bobby’s murder and the subsequent trial and media presence had on you and your community. I hope that by shining a light on his story now, more people will come to understand just how horrendous the prison system is and fight for its abolition.</p>
<p>The story of Robert Forsythe is almost certainly not unique, and only public knowledge because of the trial against the corrections officers. I recognize that many others have been killed by thermal foggers, yet we will never know their names.</p>
<p>This booklet is based on a variety of sources past and present, and to the journalists and photographers: thank you for sharing your work with the world.</p>
<p>I have no idea how many people have been involved in digitizing historical newspapers, as their names are never on anything, but y’all are fantastic and I appreciate you so much.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h1>
<p>Late in the night on July 29th, during the height of the 2020 Uprising in Portland (OR), as protesters gathered outside the Hatfield Federal Courthouse to fight for racial justice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) used a thermal fogger to deploy unknown chemical agents on the crowd:</p>

The machine is maybe four or five feet long and has a body not unlike a bush whacker with a two-cycle engine, but fueling a vaporizer instead of a rotor. The agent is holding the machine with their right hand visibly and there is a black strap across their shoulder holding it up. The machine is mostly shiny metal, although the tip is showing signs of corrosion (no surprise based on the compounds and heat) and the supports of the body are a bright green" width="500" />

<p>With this seemingly novel usage, DHS made a large swath of the populace aware of an insidious weapon that is actually not new, but – in fact – was <a href="#Genesis">birthed</a> in the American occupation of Vietnam, <a href="#The1968Convensions">perfected</a> for use against domestic protesters in the 1960s and ’70s, and <a href="#CBP">sent abroad</a> via CBP in the years since. The subsequent <a href="#PortlandOR2020_2021">return</a> of the thermal fogger to use against civilians domestically by the same domestic law enforcement agency (CBP) that sent it abroad after its initial domestic use is an extension of the classical Imperialist Boomerang <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cesaire1950" role="doc-biblioref">Césaire 1950</a>; <a href="#ref-Arendt1951" role="doc-biblioref">Arendt 1951</a>; <a href="#ref-Foucault1976" role="doc-biblioref">Foucault 1976</a>; <a href="#ref-Graham2013" role="doc-biblioref">Graham 2013</a>)</span> that can be more aptly described as a tetherball.</p>
<p>Despite repeated use of thermal foggers to deploy chemical weapons over the last half century, the device appears to have slipped from the zeitgeist, only to reemerge in the city that experienced the most visible federal deployment of chemical weapons <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Flanigan2020" role="doc-biblioref">Flanigan 2020</a>)</span> and weapons-based incidents of police brutality at racial justice protests (regardless of population size) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pb20202021" role="doc-biblioref">PB2020 Team 2021</a>)</span>, perhaps due to the noteworthy density of photographers and videographers.</p>
<p>Although not all of the weapon’s history is documented, enough is that we can quickly dispel the myth that this deployment was <em>new</em> in any notable sense other than being recent.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered">Mosquito Control</h3>
<p>Early in the deployment of US troops to occupy Vietnam, the need for large scale mosquito control became so great that soldiers began improvising insecticide foggers by piping insecticide into diesel truck exhaust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An insecticide fogger, one of the most useful improvisations, was made by mounting a [55-gallon oil] drum filled with 6 to 7 percent malathion insecticide in diesel oil … on a 3/4-ton truck and spraying the poisonous mixture out with the exhaust from the vehicle. The insecticide is drawn from the drum by the partial vacuum in a line connected to the exhaust pipe just behind the manifold, and sprayed out under pressure of the exhaust.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The hack turned out to be <strong><em>4,500 times</em></strong> more effective, covering nine square miles per day compared to 50,000 square feet (0.002 square miles) per day using a conventional manually operated fogger <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Spicknall1969" role="doc-biblioref">Spicknall 1969</a>)</span>.

<p>The US Chemical Advisor to the ARVN’s Chemical Team participated in planning the operation, and suggested using a Mity Mite (a.k.a. Mitey Mite, Mighty Mite) 2-cycle thermal fogger to aid in clearing tunnels. A 6-member unit of ARVN Chemical Team members was organized on October 7th for implementation of the fogger <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-USMACV1965" role="doc-biblioref">USMACV 1965</a>)</span>. The next day, the force located a tunnel and set into motion an elaborate scheme to fog the tunnels with <a href="https://chemicalweaponsresearch.com/hc">hexachloroethane (HC)</a> smoke from burning pots, marking the first known tactical use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons agents <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-USMACV1965" role="doc-biblioref">USMACV 1965</a>; <a href="#ref-Rottman2012" role="doc-biblioref">Rottman 2012</a>)</span>. Overall, the endeavor was dubbed a success, despite the tunnel already being empty <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-USMACV1965" role="doc-biblioref">USMACV 1965</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Although (highly toxic; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Simonis2020" role="doc-biblioref">Simonis</a> (<a href="#ref-Simonis2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>) munitions smoke was used in this application, it was noted that tear gas would be “very effective in flushing VC from tunnels” should there been any present <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-USMACV1965" role="doc-biblioref">USMACV 1965</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Lessons Learned</em> report filed by the USMACV the next month,</p>

As a result of a <a href="#TheReturn">heavy propaganda and branding campaign</a>, the thermal fogger was just becoming a mainstay of early police chemical weapons arsenals. Importantly, by the summer of 1968, the Florida Highway Patrol, Chicago Police Department, and California State Police all had purchased foggers.</p>
<p>Beyond their legacy as the first domestic fogger deployments, the lingering impact of the 1968 Conventions was felt for years to come. The Kansas City (Missouri) Police Department armed up their chemical weapons cache in advance of the 1976 Republican National Convention, including purchase of fogger fluids <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Hudson1976" role="doc-biblioref">Hudson 1976</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The first use of a thermal fogger to deploy chemical weapons in the US that I have been able to uncover was during the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Miami_riot">Liberty City Riots</a>,” which took place in during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Republican_National_Convention">1968 Republican National Convention</a> (RNC) in Miami, Florida <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">Tschenschlok 1995</a>, <a href="#ref-Tschenschlok1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>; <a href="#ref-McArdle2018" role="doc-biblioref">McArdle 2018</a>)</span>.

<p>Miami police used chemical weapons the night of the 7th, but the fogger did not make an appearance until the subsequent day. Local, state, and federal officials met with Black organizational representatives the night of the 7th and had agreed to continue discussions the morning of the 8th, but instead sent staffers rather than appear themselves, which effectively ended discussions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Tschenschlok1995" role="doc-biblioref">Tschenschlok 1995</a>, <a href="#ref-Tschenschlok1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>.

<p>The concept behind using a thermal fogger to disperse chemical weapons is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsejet">pulsejet technology</a>, which is indeed a jet propulsion method. For the purposes of thermal fogging, the chemicals are heated to ~1400 degrees Celsius (C) in a combustion chamber and the fogger uses airflow to push the chemical mixture out a long nozzle resonator that cools the fog to 100-500 C before it is blown out as fog that cools as it hits air.</p>

The text says FOG DISSEMINATION at the top then a paragraph with `Fog dissemination devices operate by rapidly vaporizing a high boiling point liquid agent formulation. This is accomplished by injecting the liquid agent into a hot gas flow and allowing the vaporized agent to contact the cooler ambient air where the agent condenses into a fog and ultimately into extremely small agent particles.` In the middle is the drawing with a square on the left with a long rectangle coming out of it to the right with a cloud out the further end of the rectangle. There are bits of text around it, pointing to the box it says `FUEL`, `SPARK`, and `COMBUSTION CHAMBER`. in the middle of the rectange it says `HOT GASES` in the middle of arrows pointing out towards the cloud. Along the rectangle another injection area is noted for `Liquid Agent Injection` Text on the bottom says `FIGURE 4. FOG DISSEMINATION. A liquid chemical agent is vaporized by a hot gas flow and released as a fog cloud`." width="500" />

<p>Although the mixture does cool considerably from its peak temperature before being released, the chemicals were heated to such high temperatures that they will thermally decompose, creating a much more toxic mixture of gasses. Indeed, the thermal cracking temperatures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenacyl_chloride">CN gas</a> (248 C <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Compton1987" role="doc-biblioref">Compton</a> (<a href="#ref-Compton1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS_gas">CS gas</a> (450 - 550 C; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Xueetal2015" role="doc-biblioref">Xue et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Xueetal2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray">Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) gas</a> (&lt; 200 C; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-HendersonandHenderson1992" role="doc-biblioref">Henderson and Henderson</a> (<a href="#ref-HendersonandHenderson1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terephthalic_acid">Terephthalic Acid (TPA) smoke</a> (445 C; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-KimyonokandUluturk2016" role="doc-biblioref">Kimyonok and Ulutürk</a> (<a href="#ref-KimyonokandUluturk2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>) are well below the temperatures achieved in a thermal fogger.</p>
<p>As a result, it is impossible for anyone to definitively know what chemicals they are fogging someone with, but it is fair to say the mixture is likely to have considerably higher toxicity than product labels and safety data sheets indicate.</p>
